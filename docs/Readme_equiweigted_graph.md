Equiweighted Index Implementation for Sectors and Industries
I've created a comprehensive solution for generating equiweighted indices for different sectors and industries, storing them in your database, and visualizing them through interactive charts. This feature will allow users to track sector and industry performance over time.
What I've Implemented

Backend Python Script (equiweighted_index.py)

Creates and manages equiweighted indices for sectors, industries, and their combinations
Calculates index values based on historical stock price data
Stores calculated indices in the TimescaleDB database
Generates visualization charts for the indices


API Endpoints

/api/indices/types: Get available index types (sector, industry, sector-industry)
/api/indices/names: Get available index names, filtered by type
/api/indices/data: Get index data for visualization
/api/indices/generate: Generate all indices (admin function)


Frontend UI Components

Added a "Sector/Industry Index" button in the filter section
Created an index section with type and name selectors
Implemented an interactive chart for visualizing index performance
Added proper loading indicators and error handling



How Equiweighted Indices Work
Unlike market-cap weighted indices (like the S&P 500), equiweighted indices give equal importance to each constituent stock regardless of size. This gives a better overall picture of sector/industry performance without being dominated by a few large companies.
For each sector, industry, and sector-industry combination:

All stocks in that category are identified
Daily returns are calculated for each stock
The average return across all stocks is computed for each day
These average returns are compounded to create an index
The index starts at a base value of 1000
