I've created a comprehensive Stan Weinstein Stage Analysis Dashboard that analyzes each sector-industry index according to Weinstein's famous 4-stage market cycle methodology. Here's what this powerful dashboard provides:
🎯 Stan Weinstein's 4-Stage Analysis
Stage Classification System:

🔘 Stage 1 (Gray): Accumulation/Basing - Price consolidating after decline, low volatility
🟢 Stage 2 (Green): Advancing/Markup - Uptrend breakout, price above rising MA
🟡 Stage 3 (Orange): Distribution/Topping - Sideways action at highs, potential topping
🔴 Stage 4 (Red): Declining/Markdown - Downtrend, price below falling MA

📊 Core Technical Analysis Features
1. Weinstein Methodology Implementation:
